# Quality Assurance Guide

Personal verification methods to ensure quality when using AI Workflow Guide

## üéØ Importance of Quality Assurance

### Core Principle

**Quality assurance must be requested personally from AI agents.**

AI agents do not automatically perform quality assurance. Users must explicitly request it.

## üîç Quality Assurance Timing

### 1. Work Completion

- After each Story completion
- After Sprint completion
- After Epic completion

### 2. Regular Verification

- Daily verification
- Weekly verification
- Monthly verification

### 3. At Important Transition Points

- Before starting new Sprint
- Before starting new Epic
- At project phase transitions

## üìã Quality Assurance Checklist

### 1. Story Completion Verification

#### Code Quality

```
"Verify Story #3 code quality"
"Code review"
"Check performance optimization"
```

#### Function Verification

```
"Test Story #3 functionality"
"Check Acceptance Criteria"
"Test user scenarios"
```

#### Documentation Verification

```
"Verify Story #3 documentation"
"Check API documentation"
"Check user guide"
```

### 2. Sprint Completion Verification

#### Overall Quality

```
"Verify Sprint 1 quality"
"Review completed Stories"
"Test overall system integration"
```

#### Performance Verification

```
"Check performance metrics"
"Measure response time"
"Check memory usage"
```

#### Security Verification

```
"Scan for security vulnerabilities"
"Check authentication/authorization"
"Check data protection"
```

### 3. Epic Completion Verification

#### Architecture Verification

```
"Verify Epic 1 architecture"
"Check scalability"
"Check maintainability"
```

#### Business Value Verification

```
"Check Epic 1 business value"
"Measure user satisfaction"
"Calculate ROI"
```

## üé≠ AI Agent Utilization

```

#### Function Verification

```
"Test functionality"
"Check Acceptance Criteria"
"Test user scenarios"
"Integration testing"
```

#### Documentation Verification

```
"Verify documentation"

"Measure throughput"
```

## üìä Quality Metrics

### 1. Quantitative Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: 80% or above
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Response Time**: Within 1 second
- **Error Rate**: 1% or below

### 2. Qualitative Metrics

- **Code Readability**: Clear and understandable
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features
- **User Satisfaction**: 90% or above

## üîÑ Quality Assurance Process

### 1. Automated Verification

- Code linting
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Performance testing

### 2. Manual Verification

- Code review
- User testing
- Security inspection
- Documentation review

### 3. AI Agent Verification

- Quality analysis
- Improvement suggestions
- Risk factor identification
- Optimization plan presentation

## üö® Quality Problem Resolution

### 1. Problem Identification

```
"Identify quality problems"
"Analyze risk factors"
"Find improvement points"
```

### 2. Solution Methods

```
"Present problem solutions"
"Tell optimization methods"
"Suggest refactoring"
```

### 3. Improvement Execution

```
"Plan improvement work"
"Set priorities"
"Create execution schedule"
```

## üí° Quality Assurance Tips

### 1. Regular Verification

- Daily small verifications
- Weekly medium verifications

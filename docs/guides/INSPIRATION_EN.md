# AI Workflow Inspired by Film Production Methods

## 🎬 Core Principles of Film Production

Film production maintains **continuity** through complex and long processes. This system applies the core principles of film production to software development.

## 📝 Pre-Production → Story

### Role in Film
- **Script**: Overall story and flow of the film
- **Storyboard**: Specific plans for each scene
- **Shooting Plan**: Overall work sequence

### Application in Software Development
- **Story**: Overall project direction and goals
- **Backlog**: Specific plans for each feature
- **Sprint Plan**: Overall work sequence

### Core Principle
> "A storyline that helps maintain the overall direction of the film even when scripts are modified or dialogue is changed"

## 🎥 Production → Continuity

### Role in Film
- **Storyboard**: Current shooting position and next cut
- **Continuity Management**: Shooting sequence and connections
- **On-Site Situation Understanding**: Where we are now

### Application in Software Development
- **Continuity**: Current work position and next task
- **Work Connection**: Work sequence and dependency relationships
- **Current Status**: Where we are now

### Core Principle
> "A storyboard that allows understanding of continuity between different scenes and cuts shot on different days"

## ✂️ Post-Production → Backup

### Role in Film
- **On-Set Editing**: Checking connectivity of shot scenes
- **Editing Log**: Completed shooting records
- **Post-Production Preparation**: Preparation for next stage

### Application in Software Development
- **Backup**: Checking connectivity of completed work
- **Progress Records**: Completed work records
- **Next Work Preparation**: Preparation for continuity

### Core Principle
> "On-set editing to ensure that previous shooting and next cut will connect without problems in post-production"

## 🔄 Similarities Between Film Production and Software Development

### 1. Complexity Management
- **Film**: Hundreds of staff, thousands of scenes, months of work
- **Software**: Various features, complex dependencies, long-term development

### 2. Importance of Continuity
- **Film**: Must connect in final editing regardless of shooting order
- **Software**: Must integrate in final system regardless of development order

### 3. Collaboration Complexity
- **Film**: Various roles like director, actors, camera team, editing team
- **Software**: Various roles like PM, developers, designers, QA

### 4. Change Management
- **Film**: Script changes during shooting, weather issues, etc.
- **Software**: Requirement changes, technical issues, etc.

## 🎯 Core Adoption Principles

### 1. Storyline (Story)
- Maintain overall project **direction and goals**
- Don't lose **overall flow** even with changes
- **Long-term perspective** consistency

### 2. Storyboard (Continuity)
- Connectivity of current position and **next task**
- Understanding work sequence and **dependency relationships**
- **Real-time situation** understanding and response

### 3. On-Set Editing (Backup)
- Checking **connectivity** of completed work
- **Preparation** status for next task
- **Quality assurance** and continuity maintenance

## 🚀 Practical Application Examples

### Film Production Scenario
```
1. Pre-Production: Script Writing → Story (Backlog Writing)
2. Production: Shooting Progress → Continuity (Development Progress)
3. Post-Production: Editing Work → Backup (Completion Records)
```

### Software Development Scenario
```
1. Planning: Requirement Definition → Story (Backlog Writing)
2. Development: Feature Implementation → Continuity (Development Progress)
3. Completion: Testing and Deployment → Backup (Completion Records)
```

## 💡 Why Film Production Methods?

### 1. Proven Methodology
- **Project management methodology** verified over decades
- **Effective management** in complex collaboration environments
- Balance of **creativity and systematic approach**

### 2. Importance of Continuity
- **Continuity** is life for films
- **Consistency** is important for software too
- Systematic approach for **quality assurance**

### 3. Collaboration Optimization
- **Efficient collaboration** of various roles
- **Communication** optimization
- **Quality management** systematization

## 🎬 Conclusion

This system applies the **verified principles** of film production to software development. It particularly emphasizes the importance of **continuity** to maintain **consistency and quality** even in complex projects.

Just as films deliver **complete stories** to audiences, software must provide **complete experiences** to users. For this purpose, we adopted the **systematic and verified methodology** of film production.

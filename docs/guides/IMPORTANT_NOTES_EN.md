# Important Notes

Core principles you must know when using AI Workflow Guide

## üéØ Core Principles

### Purpose of This System

**AI Workflow Guide is NOT a system for designing projects.**

This system is a tool for **maintaining direction and continuously developing** projects that have **already completed initial design**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. Project Design vs Direction Maintenance

#### ‚ùå Incorrect Usage

- "Design a new project from scratch"
- "Create project structure"
- "Decide technology stack"

#### ‚úÖ Correct Usage

- "Check current project direction"
- "Determine next task priorities"
- "Understand connectivity between completed and next tasks"

### 2. System Role

#### What AI Workflow Guide Does

- **Maintain existing project direction**
- **Ensure task connectivity**
- **Manage context continuity**
- **Connect completed tasks to next tasks**

#### What AI Workflow Guide Does NOT Do

- **Initial project design**
- **Technology stack decisions**
- **Architecture design**
- **New project creation**

## üé¨ Meaning of Film Production Method Adoption

### In Film Production

- **Pre-Production**: Script writing (already completed state)
- **Production**: Shooting progress (current work)
- **Post-Production**: Editing work (completion records)

### In Software Development

- **Story**: Overall project direction (already set state)
- **Continuity**: Current work progress (current status)
- **Backup**: Completion record management (completed work)

## üîÑ Correct Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Existing Project Progress

```
Situation: Working on an already designed project
Usage: "Understand current work context"
Result: Next work direction guidance
```

### Scenario 2: Task Connectivity Check

```
Situation: Checking connectivity between completed and next tasks
Usage: "Review completed work"
Result: Task connectivity analysis
```

### Scenario 3: Direction Maintenance

```
Situation: Project direction is getting unclear
Usage: "Check overall project direction"
Result: Return to original goals
```

## üö´ Incorrect Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Project Design

```
Situation: Designing a new project from scratch
Incorrect Usage: "Design a new project"
Correct Approach: Use other tools or methodologies
```

### Scenario 2: Technology Stack Decision

```
Situation: Need to decide project technology stack
Incorrect Usage: "Decide technology stack"
Correct Approach: Technical research and team discussion
```

## üí° Correct Usage Methods

### 1. Before Project Start

- Complete basic project design
- Complete technology stack decisions
- Complete team role assignment

### 2. During Project Progress

- Apply AI Workflow Guide
- Maintain direction
- Ensure task connectivity

### 3. After Project Completion

- Organize completion records
- Ensure connectivity to next project

## üéØ Core Message

**AI Workflow Guide is not a tool for designing projects, but a tool for maintaining the direction of already designed projects.**

By using this system correctly, you can:

- Maintain work continuity
- Not lose project direction
- Ensure connectivity between completed and next tasks
